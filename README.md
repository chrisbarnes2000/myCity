# CapRover Django

This project template aims to provide a more real-world Django template including:

- PostgreSQL
- Instructions for CapRover setup
- Handling of Django settings

This template is a baseline extracted from our experience with running Django production workloads on CapRover.
__It is provided as is - without any warranty!__

If you find any bugs or have suggestions to better this template please feel free to open a issue or submit a merge request.

# Setup

During the setup we will refer to the django app as `demo-django` and the prostgre app as `demo-db`.
You may change this names to your liking

- You have ssh access to you CapRover server

## 2) CapRover

- Create a postgre app from the one-click wizard
- Choose `demo` for the name as this will automatically be prefixed with `-db`
- Note username, database and password

- Create a new blank app with the name `demo-django`
- Fill the environment variables below and enter them with the bulk edit mode

    ```zsh
