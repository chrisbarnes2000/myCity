Their interactions will be limited to the button options available being checked for incorrect responses and then handled accordingly, either by re-prompting the user for a correct input or by wasting their chance, given the importance or value of the interaction.

#### User Journey

“I wish to play an old-RPG-style game. I have looked but with all the new technology all the old classics have been ‘innovated to the latest HD experience’. Then I stumbled upon the remake of dungeon heroes.”

“I was looking for cool ASCII art designs for my website and came across this game, I was curious to see what characters they had and I've just become enveloped in how awesome of a game it actually is. “

“I love how the store is based solely on in-game currencies and how easier it is to navigate via on-screen support or keyboard controls. Plus the store NPC has a nice personable attitude added to its dialog.”
