## Based on this [post](https://blog.alfred.software/2020/02/12/how-to-create-your-own-heroku-clone-and-setup-django-and-postgres/) and this [repo](https://gitlab.com/kamneros/caprover-django), [myCity](https://my-city.club) is an educational app to keep users informed of legal rights & local laws as well as available support resources nearby.

- **Your legal rights & local laws**:
  - (providing you with lawfirms in your town, and resources to learn about in case you feel you become unlawfully detained)

- **Available support resources**:
  - govt agencies,
  - non-profits,
  - local businesses
  - and other places that help with things such as:
    - medical info,
    - recovery resources,
    - access to food,
    - housing,
    - etc

- Later we plan to allow for **Instantly submitting and track benefits** applications via mobile app and mobile/user-friendly website. (Itâ€™s the get calfresh for all benefits.)

## Built With

- **[`psycopg2-binary`](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/)**: Stand-alone version of `psycopg2`, the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
- **[`whitenoise`](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/)**: With a couple of lines of config WhiteNoise allows your web app to serve its own static files, making it a self-contained unit that can be deployed anywhere without relying on nginx, Amazon S3 or any other external service. Especially useful on Heroku, OpenShift and other PaaS providers.
- **[`django-admin-env-notice`](https://github.com/dizballanze/django-admin-env-notice)**: Visually distinguish environments in Django Admin.

## Looking Into

- **[`django-admin-honeypot`](https://django-admin-honeypot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**: django-admin-honeypot is a fake Django admin login screen to log and notify admins of attempted unauthorized access.
- **[`django-allauth`](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)**: Django Allauth offers a fully integrated authentication app that allows for both local and social authentication.
- **[`djangorestframework`](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)**: Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **[`django-google-maps`](https://pypi.org/project/django-google-maps/)**: is a simple application that provides the basic hooks into google maps V3 api for use in Django
