                        Henry is an iOS developer at the Make School Product college. Focusing time into mobile development, he works on building the UI for a number of different projects ranging from consumer based applications, mobile games, to educational / resources apps that would assist others. Always looking for an opportunity, he is furthering his goals by looking into data science and beyond the simple scope of mobile alone. His primary goal is to work on and build projects that would bring happiness to other people, no matter the format. With this project, he hopes to further help others, and also help develop his skills beyond the current strain by working out building a custom API that a mobile app could work with as well as making a project that works between two different formats.
