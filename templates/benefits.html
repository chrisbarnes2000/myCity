    <h2>How To Apply for Disability in California</h2>
    Consult this <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/hlp/radr/10/ovw001-checklist.pdf">Checklist</a>  <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> to find out exactly what you’ll need:
    <ol>
        <li>Apply for Disability <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/">online</a>  <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> at the SSA's website</li>
            You can use the online application to apply for disability benefits if you:
            <ul>
                <li>Are age 18 or older.</li>
                <li>Are not currently receiving benefits on your own Social Security record.</li>
                <li>Are unable to work because of a medical condition that is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death; and</li>
                <li>Have not been denied for disability in the last 60 days</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Note</strong>: If your application was recently denied, our <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/appeal.html">Internet Appeal application</a>  <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> is a starting point to request a review of the determination we made.
        <li>telephone by calling the SSA's customer service: 1-800-772-1213,</li>
        <li>or in-person at their local Social Security field office.</li>
    </ol>

    You can now also file for <strong>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</strong> online but only if you:
    <ul>
        <li>Are between the ages of 18 and 65.</li>
        <li>Have never been married.</li>
        <li>Are a U.S. citizen residing in one of the fifty states, District of Columbia, or the Northern Mariana Islands.</li>
        <li>Haven’t applied for or received SSI benefits in the past; and</li>
        <li>Are applying for Social Security Disability Insurance at the same time as your SSI claim.</li>
    </ul>

    Note that <strong>getting approved for long-term permanent Disability and SSI is a long and frustrating process</strong>;
    <br>
    Long as in it often takes years to get approved from the day you first applied. The general rule is that they deny pretty much everyone the first time they apply, and make you appeal. It might be a good idea to find a disability lawyer. They usually will take their fees from the settlement if/when they win your case.
